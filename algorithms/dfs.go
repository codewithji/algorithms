package algorithms

// Depth First Search runs with a time complexity of O(V + E) and
// is often used as a building block in other algorithms

// By itself, DFS isn't all that useful, but when augmented to perform
// other tasks such as count connected components or determine connectivity,
// then DFS really shines
